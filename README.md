Tool to assist patients in finding out how long wait times are from referral to specialist appointments for all departments and hospitals in England.  
   
- ETL extracts data from multiple sources including hidden NHS API and large web hosted csv's
- Async optimised with insert perf timings of 0.5s for table with 44,616 items, and 2.2s for table with 482,783 items
- CI/CD pipeline ensures no touch operation, ETL runs daily at 2am to collect fresh NHS data & update historical trends
- Full RDBMS with data stored on the server automatically maintaining historical tables through MySQL triggers 
- Utilises Google Geocode & Maps APIs (+more!) 
- Additional NEW CI/CD integration includes unittesting and quality assurance  
- Various data analysis (numpy, statistics, itertools, collections) 
- Data viz with eCharts & Altair  
  
Please note I've taken the repo down while I refactor the project, though you can still view the screenshots and features in a copy of the old readme [here](https://github.com/ceefar/NHS_Readme).
