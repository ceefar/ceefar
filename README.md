### üòç What am I up to?

I've put together a load of projects in a short time, but here are a few to check out from my current portfolio  
  
### NHS Wait Times

<img src="https://github.com/ceefar/PyGame/blob/master/RepoImages/v2_home_concept_preview.png" width="800">   
  
Tool to assist patients in finding out how long wait times are from referral to specialist appointments for all departments and hospitals in England.  
   
Please note I've taken this down while I refactor the project, though you can still view the screenshots and features in a copy of the old readme [here](https://github.com/ceefar/NHS_Readme).
  
- ETL extracts data from multiple sources including hidden NHS API and large web hosted csv's
- Async optimised with insert perf timings of 0.5s for table with 44,616 items, and 2.2s for table with 482,783 items
- Utilises Google Geocode & Maps APIs (+more!) 
- Automatically maintains historical data through MySQL triggers 
- Various data analysis (numpy, statistics, itertools, collections) 
- Data viz with eCharts & Altair
- CI/CD pipeline ensures no touch operation, ETL runs daily at 2am to collect fresh NHS data & update historical trends
- Additional NEW CI/CD integration includes unittesting and quality assurance 
     
     
### PyGame - *Winner Winner Zombie Dinner*    
<sup>[ bfs | dijkstra's | graph | dequeue | vectors | pygame | profiling | ui | optimisations | software-engineering | game-dev | game-design ]</sup>     
Software engineering focused project I used to brush up on OOP, showcase a multitude of skills including intermediate & advanced algorithms and data-structures, OOP, frontend / ui, etc.   
   
GIF below shows implementation of Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm using dequeue, running in pygame mostly off CPU (not GPU) at 60 fps, plus updated custom sprites in Lego style     
*Note halted development for more industry relevant projects - still aiming to put out a public repo in late Dec 2022.*
