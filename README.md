### üòç What am I up to?

I've put together a load of projects in a short time, but here is are the two you should check out from my current portfolio  
  
### NHS Wait Times

<img src="https://github.com/ceefar/NHS_wait_times/blob/main/v2_home_concept_preview.png" width="800">  
    
Tool to assist patients in finding out how long wait times are from referral to specialist appointments for all departments and hospitals in England. Check out the repo for more preview images of the web app pages. Topics include...

- ETL for extracting large publicly available NHS datasets, cleaning the data, and loading it to my own hosted database
- Optimised for speed using Asyncio, Pandas, prepared statements, & bulk inserts allows for entire ETL (extract CSV, clean dataset, insert to my web hosted db) in 0.5s for table with 44,616 items, and 2.2s for table with 482,783 items
- Pulls live data from a *hidden* NHS API in json format, plus utilises Google Geocode & Maps APIs (+more!) 
- Automatically maintains historical data through MySQL triggers, view back visualised trends in each departments data history 
- Various data analysis (using numpy, statistics, itertools, collections) and data visualisations with eCharts & Altair
- Basic CI/CD pipeline ensures no touch operation by running the ETL daily to ensure data fresh and historical trends are accurate 
- Additional NEW CI/CD integration includes unittesting, improved v2_concept db schema, and quality assurance on data completeness
- Project currently undergoing v2 concept refactor, expected live Early Dec 2022
     
     
### PyGame - *Winner Winner Zombie Dinner*    
<sup>[ bfs | dijkstra's | graph | dequeue | vectors | pygame | profiling | ui | optimisations | software-engineering | game-dev | game-design ]</sup>     
Actually my currently in development project, more software engineering focused to showcase a multitude of skills including front-end/ui, intermediate & advanced algorithms and data-structures, OOP, etc. Image below shows implementation of Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm using dequeue *(currently in-development)*   
*Note in-dev version still private while it's being finished - public repo expected early Nov 2022.*

### ETL Dashboard   
Data visualisation for Data Engineering Bootcamp Project  
- Check it out [HERE](https://ceefar-etl-dashboard-app-insights-7xqywv.streamlitapp.com/)  
- Be sure to have a look at the **Portfolio Mode**, which will allow you to see the live code update the dynamic queries based on the user selected inputs

### :sunglasses: A bit about me  
  
A tireless worker, with unrivaled determination and an innate passion for learning plus all things tech, alongside being a strong communicator with a background in performing having been a member of the _National Theatre_, and have a deep understanding of business value from past entreprenureal ventures. I excel at problem solving and aquire skills at lightning speed due to my genuine joy of learning, and my absolute obsession with technology.

I studied game software developed at _Sheffield Hallam University_ and recently completed the _Generation Data Engineering Bootcamp_. Since I took quite a few years away from programming after my time at University I'm looking to get back into the STEM profession in a Jnr role, though certainly wouldn't shy away from any given opportunity as I find I am at my best when I push myself to achieve my potential.
